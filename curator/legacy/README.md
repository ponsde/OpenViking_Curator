# Legacy v1 modules

These files are kept for reference only. They are **not importable** as-is
because their relative imports point to the parent `curator` package.

If you need to reference the old logic, read the source files directly.

Files:
- `pipeline.py` — v1 pipeline (replaced by `curator.pipeline_v2`)
- `retrieval.py` — v1 retrieval with keyword matching (replaced by `curator.retrieval_v2`)
